# 020 Recursion

- ### [01. Write a recursive function to determine whether all digits of the number are odd or not.](https://github.com/martun-avagyan/020-Recursion-DS/blob/main/01allOddOrNot.js)

- ### [02. Given an array of numbers. Write a recursive function to find its minimal positive element. (if such element does not exist, return -1).](https://github.com/martun-avagyan/020-Recursion-DS/blob/main/02minPosInt.js)

- ### [03. Given an array of numbers which is almost sorted in ascending order. Find the index where sorting order is violated.]()

- ### [04. Given an array. Write a recursive function that removes the first element and returns the given array. (without using arr.shift())]()

- ### [05. Given an array of nested arrays. Write a recursive function that flattens it. (Hint create function that concats arrays).]()

- ### [06. Given an array and a number N. Write a recursive function that rotates an array N places to the left. (Hint: to add element to the beginning use arr.unshift())]()

- ### [07. Given a number. Write a function that calculates its sum of the digits and if that sum has more than 1 digit find the sum of digits of that number. Repeat that process if needed and return the result.]()
